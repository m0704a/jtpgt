The diagram above illustrates, in two-dimensional⏎
form, how healing occurs. In reality, the three⏎
fields are one, and multidimensional or, more⏎
correctly, non-dimensional. The body, denoted⏎
by the outermost black line, is created and⏎
maintained by the Life Field; this is subject⏎
to the Thought Field which, in turn, is⏎
'subject' * to the Spirit 43 (of the person).⏎
