being on our own is the lot of many of⏎
us for periods of varying lengths. we⏎
feel lonely and wish for companionship⏎
because being alone is not something usual⏎
in our experience. most enjoy the intimate⏎
presence of a partner for all the many⏎
reasons there are and, on being separated⏎
having to cope with the feeling of loss⏎
by departure of any kind, find ourselves⏎
that ensues.⏎
