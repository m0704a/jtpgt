being on our own is the lot of many of us for⏎
periods of varying lengths. we feel lonely and⏎
wish for companionship because being alone is⏎
not something usual in our experience. most⏎
enjoy the intimate presence of a partner for⏎
all the many reasons there are and, on being⏎
separated by departure of any kind, find ourselves⏎
having to cope with the feeling of loss that ensues.⏎
however, as has been stated before, everything⏎
happens for a good reason and this may be that⏎

its purposes in solitude. This lesson isn't ready⏎
