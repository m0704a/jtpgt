Two friends were swimming in a river when one⏎
was caught in a  current. The other proffered⏎
a helping hand from the security of a tree but⏎
the friend's response was, "You insult me by⏎
suggesting that I need help, I do not want your⏎
help!" and was swept away in the turbulent⏎
waters to be bashed and bruised and cut, until⏎
the tranquillity of the estuary was reached,⏎
and the safety of the shore.⏎
